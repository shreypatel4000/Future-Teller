# Future-Teller
1.It is a code that I wrote while practicing arrays, random operator and switch statement but, SWITCH WON'T WORK! So I used if-statement instead.. 

2.To try it out, download it.. go to the downloaded folder, type cmd in the above 'file search' section (where u usually search ur files), then type there, a black screen will open and type in there, 'javac FutureTeller.java', without any typing mistake. Then wait for a while and after the next line appears, type, 'java FutureTeller' in there and it will start by asking ur name. 

Note - Please don't hesitate to try it just 'cuz the method to make it work is length-y. Try is out! It will be worth that hard work, i promise.
